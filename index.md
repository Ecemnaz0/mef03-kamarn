## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pjournal/mef03-kamarn/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Week 1 - RMarkdown Homework

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pjournal/mef03-kamarn/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Homework 2 - BKM Data Analyis

Please see my homework about data analysis on BKM Sektörel Gelişim reports. After I gathered data from BKM reports, ı analysed progression of different sectors using dplyr and ggplt2 packages. You can see my analysis clicking on this [link.](https://github.com/pjournal/mef03-kamarn/blob/master/BKM_report-_data.html)
